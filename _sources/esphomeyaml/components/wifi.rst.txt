WiFi Component
==============

This core esphomelib component sets up WiFi connections to access points
for you. It needs to be in your configuration or otherwise esphomeyaml
will fail in the config validation stage.

Itâ€™s recommended to provide a static IP for your node, as it can
dramatically improve connection times.
