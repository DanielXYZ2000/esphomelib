/** BinaryOutput - The base class for all binary outputs i.e. outputs that can only be switched on/off.
 *
 * This interface class provides one method you need to override in order to create a binary output
 * component yourself: write_value(). This method will be called for you by the MQTT Component through
 * set_state() to indicate that a new value should be written to hardware.
 *
 * Note that this class also allows the user to invert any state, but you don't need to worry about that
 * because the value will already be inverted (if specified by the user) within set_state_(). So write_state
 * will always receive the correctly inverted state.
 *
 * Additionally, this class provides high power mode capabilities using PowerSupplyComponent. Every time
 * the output is enabled (independent of inversion!), the power supply will automatically be turned on.
